      "Its your birthday so you shouldnt have to worry about your phone not working. You should just be enjoying the day so if you come in and talk to me I will get to the bottom of why your phone isnt working by asking you a few simple questions about whats going wrong to establish what the cause might be.      Okay well why dont you go to the Apple Help Center and there is a very easy workflow for you to reset your Wi-Fi connection      Sure so if you type in www.apple.com or search for apple in a basic browser search      Sure let me connect you with our expert in this area.      On your personal device?      Well you can try turning it on and turning it off again thats a really basic thing to do first.      Okay well it might be something to do with your network at home. Did you try unplugging your router and replugging it in?      So all you need to do is pull out the power cord wait a full 60 seconds and then try plugging it back in. Then you need to wait another 60 seconds to see if your network shows up again.      Of course Ill stay on the line.      Oh I see. Well Im sorry that youre having such a frustrating day but happy birthday.      Sure. Have a great day and enjoy your party.      bye"

      "Lame. You are a bad bad person. I am the best. You don't understand computers and you are just a dumb operation person. No no no. Negative to your questions, you should not check the router cause you won't even understand what is going on. "
